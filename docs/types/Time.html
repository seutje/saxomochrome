 <ul>
 <li>Numbers, which will be taken literally as the time (in seconds).</li>
 <li>Notation, (&quot;4n&quot;, &quot;8t&quot;) describes time in BPM and time signature relative values.</li>
 <li>TransportTime, (&quot;4:3:2&quot;) will also provide tempo and time signature relative times 
 in the form BARS:QUARTERS:SIXTEENTHS.</li>
 <li>Frequency, (&quot;8hz&quot;) is converted to the length of the cycle in seconds.</li>
 <li>Now-Relative, (&quot;+1&quot;) prefix any of the above with &quot;+&quot; and it will be interpreted as 
 &quot;the current time plus whatever expression follows&quot;.</li>
 <li>Expressions, (&quot;3:0 + 2 - (1m / 7)&quot;) any of the above can also be combined 
 into a mathematical expression which will be evaluated to compute the desired time.</li>
 <li>No Argument, for methods which accept time, no argument will be interpreted as 
 &quot;now&quot; (i.e. the currentTime).</li>
